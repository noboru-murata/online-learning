* online-learning

Learning is a flexible and effective means of extracting the
stochastic structure of the environment.  In practice, two different
types of learning are used, namely batch learning and on-line
learning. The batch learning procedure uses all the training examples
repeatedly so that its performance is compared to the statistical
estimation procedure. On-line learning is more dynamical, updating the
current estimate by observing a new datum one by one. On-line learning
is slow in general but works well in the changing environment. We give
a unified framework of statistical analysis for batch and on-line
learning. The topics include the asymptotic learning curve,
generalization error and training error, over-fitting and
over-training, efficiency of learning, and an adaptive method of
determining learning rate.
